# Congratulations, you found my dotfiles repo!
I'm only putting these up here in case my system explodes, or in case I get another urge to go on a dotfile hackfest that goes totally awry and needs some source control rescue. Why the README then? Well, github strongly recommended having one!

## Pre-Requisites
* ZSH (I use 4.3.15, YMMV)
* VCPrompt
* RVM
* Git
* reattach-to-user-namespace ( brew install reattach-to-user-namespace )
* VIM compiled with Ruby Support: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3794895/installing-vim-with-ruby-support-ruby or MacVim

(If you're only installing the VIM files you can ignore all but the last pre-req)

## Installin'
Simply clone the repo, CD into it. Run

>ruby install.rb

You will be prompted to choose between all/zsh/vim files. It will symlink the files from their current location to your home folder. It won't back up anything you already have existing.. so, yeah, careful!

If you want to install the vim plugins as well, make sure you're using system ruby (in an attempt at automating command-T's native extension compilation, this helps!) then!

>cd _vim
>ruby update_bundle.rb

should work just fine.

### ZSH
you can install the latest zsh with

>brew install zsh

then add /usr/local/bin/zsh to your /etc/shells file (probably using sudo) then run

>chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh

basically this prompt shows hostname:directory(branch+*?) (where the +*? denote the state of the working directory in git). tmux configuration with tabs and simple vim-like bindings. autocd and colors and all that. nothing too fancy

### VIM
Pretty minimalist.

#### Plugins
* Command-T
* AckVim
* NerdTREE
* Powerline 
note: powerline has a problem on osx 10.8.2 - remove duplicate pythons--brew uninstall python ...leaving only original system python.
you may have to then install pip:
su (become root) $ easy_install pip
then install powerline:
su (become root) $ pip install https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/tarball/develop
* Fugitive
* TComment
* A few syntax files, who even cares about those.

#### Bindings In Normal Mode
* Leader: comma (,) or backslash (\) (I don't pick sides)
* g/  : ack ( directory search shortcut )
* g\* : ack current word
* gn  : next in cabinet
* gp  : previous in cabinet
* gq  : close cabinet
* gc  : Comment line

Leader Stuff

* Leader + fs : Go fullscreen without Lion swoosh effect ( MacVim only )
* Leader + cw : Trim trailing whitespace
* Leader + t  : Command-T file browser
* Leader + fr : Refresh Command-T
* Leader + fb : Command-T buffer list
* Leader + nt : toggle NERDTree

#### Bindings In Insert Mode
* Ctrl + L    : insert hash-rocket (=>)
* Ctrl + K    : insert method-missile (->)


## A few notes on VCPrompt
> curl https://raw.github.com/djl/vcprompt/v1.0.1/bin/vcprompt > /usr/local/bin/vcprompt && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vcprompt

or

brew install vcprompt
